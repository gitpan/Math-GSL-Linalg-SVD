Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD version 0.0.2

DESCRIPTION

The singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important factorization of a rectangular real matrix - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition. Eigendecomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix. This module implements the SVD and Eigen decomposition routines of the The C GNU Scientific Library (GSL). It provides simple convinience methods in the upper-level Math::GSL::Linalg::SVD namespace to perform these operations. Alternatively, it also provides direct access to the C routines in the Math::GSL::Linalg::SVD::Matrix, Math::GSL::Linalg::SVD::Vector and Math::GSL::Linalg::SVD::Eigen namespaces.
